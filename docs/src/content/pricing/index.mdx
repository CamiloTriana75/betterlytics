## Frequently Asked Questions

### Billing Questions

**Q: What counts as an event?**
A: Each time someone loads a page on your website with our tracking script, or performs an action on your website where a custom event is triggered. Repeated refreshes within short periods of time don't count. Additionally, we try to eliminate bot traffic from being counted as events to the best of our ability.

**Q: Do unused events carry over to the next month?**
A: No, events don't roll over. You pay for a monthly allowance (e.g., up to 100K events), and this resets each billing cycle regardless of usage.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my plan limit?**
A: You'll receive notifications as you approach your limit. We provide a grace period and won't cut off your service immediately, unless the limit is exceeded by a large amount.

**Q: Can I change plans anytime?**
A: Yes! Upgrade instantly or downgrade at the end of your billing cycle.
