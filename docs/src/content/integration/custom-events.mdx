# Custom Events

Track specific user interactions and behaviors beyond standard page views. Custom events help you understand how visitors engage with your content and achieve your business goals.

## What Are Custom Events?

Custom events let you track specific actions users take on your website:

- **Button clicks** - CTA buttons, navigation, social sharing
- **Form submissions** - Contact forms, newsletters, signups
- **File downloads** - PDFs, images, documents
- **Video interactions** - Play, pause, completion
- **E-commerce actions** - Add to cart, purchase, checkout steps
- **Custom interactions** - Any behavior specific to your site
