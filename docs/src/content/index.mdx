# Introduction

**Betterlytics** is a modern, privacy-first analytics platform that provides powerful insights about your website traffic without compromising user privacy.

## Perfect Analytics for Modern Websites

We built Betterlytics because we believe you shouldn't have to choose between understanding your audience and respecting their privacy. Our **cookieless, GDPR-compliant** analytics platform is designed for the privacy-conscious web, giving you comprehensive insights without the headache of cookie consent banners or invasive user tracking.

### What Makes Us Different

In a world where privacy regulations are tightening and users are increasingly concerned about their digital footprint, traditional analytics solutions feel outdated. That's where we come in.

**Privacy isn't an afterthought for us. It's our foundation.** We're GDPR, CCPA, and PECR compliant straight out of the box, which means you can focus on growing your business instead of worrying about compliance. Since we don't use cookies at all, your visitors won't be bombarded with annoying consent banners that hurt your conversion rates.

**Speed matters, and we deliver.** Built with Rust and ClickHouse for lightning-fast performance. Your dashboard loads instantly, and our tracking script weighs in at under 1KB, so lightweight that your visitors won't even notice it's there.

**Beautiful data deserves a beautiful interface.** Our dashboard, crafted with Next.js 15 and React 19, doesn't just look modern. It makes complex data feel intuitive. Whether you're a marketing manager checking campaign performance or a developer analyzing user behavior, you'll find exactly what you need without digging through endless menus.

Most importantly, **your data stays yours.** We don't track users across websites, we don't sell data to third parties, and we give you complete ownership of your analytics. It's that simple.

## Everything You Need to Grow

Understanding your audience shouldn't require a PhD in data science. That's why we've designed Betterlytics to surface the insights that actually matter for your business growth.

### Know Your Audience

See who's visiting your site right now with our live tracking feature, and discover which channels are bringing you the highest-quality traffic. Whether your visitors are coming from search engines, social media, or direct referrals, you'll understand not just the quantity but the quality of each traffic source.

Our geographic insights help you understand your global reach, while detailed device and browser data lets you optimize your site for the platforms your audience actually uses. No more guessing. Just actionable data that helps you make better decisions.

### Improve Performance

Every page on your website tells a story, and our performance metrics help you understand which stories resonate most with your audience. Track user journeys to see how visitors navigate through your site, identify where they drop off, and optimize your most important conversion funnels.

Need to track specific actions that matter to your business? Our custom event tracking lets you measure everything from newsletter signups to product demos. And with comprehensive UTM campaign tracking, you'll finally know which marketing efforts are actually driving results.

### Privacy Without Compromise

Here's how we protect your visitors while giving you the insights you need: We collect zero personally identifiable information, not even email addresses or names. Visitor IP addresses are immediately anonymized through hashing and never stored in their original form.

Each website's data is completely isolated, so there's no cross-site tracking or data sharing. We believe in transparency, which means you know exactly what data we collect, how we process it, and most importantly, that you maintain complete ownership of it.
